# 🤖 Participedia Data Chatbot

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a *data processing pipeline and NLP-based chatbot prototype* using the Participedia dataset.  
It enables users to explore participatory democracy data efficiently through automated data extraction, cleaning, and natural language processing techniques.

The chatbot processes text from Participedia cases, methods, and organizations, extracts insights, and provides intelligent query-based responses through natural language interaction.

## 🧩 Key Features
- Extracts datasets from *Google Cloud Storage (GCS)*.  
- Scrapes and processes web data from Participedia URLs using *BeautifulSoup*.  
- Cleans and structures text data for NLP applications.  
- Performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on participatory cases, methods, and organizations.  
- Generates *text embeddings* using the Transformers library.  
- Implements *chatbot logic* to answer participation-related questions.
